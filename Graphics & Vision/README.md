This is where I will be doing graphics and vision work. Click the above folders to dive into what I've learned/created!!! 
I will also be writing on the idea of space below.

# What is space?
We move through this substrate that we call the environment, and only in this environment are we able to live. We function such that without the perfect pressure(which is
directly correlated to tempurature and the nature of the substance the pressure is measured in) we cease to be *able* to function....
What the hell! What *underlies* the idea of the composition? We have no idea why we live in such a space. 
Why do we perceive distance the way that we do? Why do we perceive color the way that we do?
Why is our whole world based around this idea of space, which can only be broken down mathematically essentially? What is the actual essence of space?
