This is a compilation of things that I am currently working on just for fun! 
I will be working through certain topics and buillding learning resources for those interested in learning said topics.
It ranges over a wide variety of topics and will be divided up into many differnt subsections including but not limited to:

- graphics/vision, 
- AI(NLP,ML,econCS,etc.), 
- distributed computing(networking, concurrency, systems, etc.), 
- programming languages(object oriented/programming language design)
- math/algorithms(graph theory, combinatorial optimization, cryptography/crptocurrency, computational geometry, etc.)
```

Started learning concurrency with Go and Networking with C++

Currently going to focus on dist sys due to nature of job

##### 1/2/2022
I'm focusing more on Networking, specifically looking into compression techniques and the nature of compression. At the end of my exploration I will contribute to some open source project or I will look to make my own compression algorithm.

I have been thinking about security and automation for quite a while and I think the next topics I will explore will be these. I will probably explore VPNs/Proxys for security and will write some bash scripts for things I find important. I will contribute to some open source in parallel to playing with said things.
