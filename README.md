This is a compilation of things that I am currently working on just for fun! It ranges over a wide variety of topics and will be
divided up into many differnt subsections including graphics/vision, AI(NLP,ML,econCS,etc.), distributed computing(networking, concurrency, systems, etc.), programming languages(object oriented/programming language design), and math/algorithms(graph theory, combinatorial optimization, cryptography/crptocurrency, computational geometry, etc.).
