This is a compilation of things that I am currently working on just for fun! 
I will be working through certain topics and buillding learning resources for those interested in learning said topics.
It ranges over a wide variety of topics and will be divided up into many differnt subsections including but not limited to:

- graphics/vision, 
- AI(NLP,ML,econCS,etc.), 
- distributed computing(networking, concurrency, systems, etc.), 
- programming languages(object oriented/programming language design)
- math/algorithms(graph theory, combinatorial optimization, cryptography/crptocurrency, computational geometry, etc.)
```

##### 5/7/2021
Semester just ended, I'll be starting my learning with Networking(distributed-computing/networking)
and with WebSystems(distributed-computing/WebSystems).

##### 5/9/2021
I want financial freedom, so I think that rather than doing Networking right now I might want to start 
with everything around cryptography/cryptocurrency. I will still be doing WebSystems as it is extremely
relevant to my internship.
